# Stream notes January 31, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Stream Review
- [x] Stream Updates
- [ ] Raid over plans
- [x] Stream assets
- [x] Streamdeck 15 key
- [x] OBS I learned a thing!!
- [ ] Repo reviews and get the VARS in place
- [ ] Retrospective, Live Q&A

## Things we learned

- My audio redirect for stream elements is not working UNLESS I have the SE editor open
- In the coding view, I'm not always hearing the audible alerts
- I'm really bad about post-stream issue cleanup and transfer to github repo issues (sadface)
-

## Notes

- Loopback, a pricy paid app on the mac, is NOT intuitive for its purpose (this also could be my ignorance with OBS audio input settings)
- If you are pushing a bunch of commits and it seems really slow, you done goofed, revert
