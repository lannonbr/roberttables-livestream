# Stream notes January 29, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Stream Review
- [x] Stream Updates
- [x] Raid over plans
- [x] A failed effort... but we're getting there!
- [x] Stream expectations
- [ ] Do a Thing! (Live, I dunno)
- [x] Retrospective, stream plans, help needed

## Things we learned

- [x] I'm hearing the streamelements events, but audience is not (solved?)
- [x] Also, the audio chirp from the event no longer kills my mic (win?)
- [x] But the visual alert is visible on stream (overlay audio redirect via loopback, maybe)
- [x] Works on my machine _lul_

## Notes

- [ ] Stop failing on raids/hosts. use a command and stop browsering it, plebe
