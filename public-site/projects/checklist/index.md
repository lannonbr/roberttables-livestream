# Go-Live Checklist

The following is my go-live checklist for a Twitch stream. I'm adding
this in version control and publishing it for others to adapt.

As the stream needs change, equipment changes, automation is created,
I will update this to represent my actual workflow, in the interest
of transparency and sharing.

Some exceptions exist that I will not document, however. No one needs
to know when I use the restroom or grab a beer or something. Adapt
this to fit your needs.

## Pre-golive

Timing for this is usually 2 to 4 hours before the go-live. This allows
me to pay attention, and make sure I get the word out early enough. It
also allows me to keep enough time open for work-related commitments.
