# Stream notes July 2, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Welcome back
- [x] Show and tell
- [x] Additional thoughts on a sane, serverless-ish, chatbot
- [x] Get docker compose up with a service or two
- [x] Recap, retro, raid

## Goals

- [x] Does the container work?
- [x] Get it up with compose
- [x] See a log stream from a thing
- [ ] Make the bot talk... without getting banned. Again

## What did we learn

- Start compose in the right directory
- Comfyjs handles parsing the user for you
- Message prop is whatever is after the command (in onCommand)

## Next steps

- We want to have a service with auth credentials to Say into chat
- We need env variable (using only docker compose env for now)

## Meta

- 4ndrexx - 'npm install --silent' over 'npm install --quiet'
