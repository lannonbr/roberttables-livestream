# Stream notes Feburary 12, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Project(s) overview
- [x] Happy Made Up Holiday!
- [x] Show-and-tell
- [x] Tale of the heccin keyboard
- [ ] Raid plans (AdronHall - )
- [ ] Do some things
- [ ] Retrospective

## Things we learned

- Test the ip out put we desire ipv4, but some give ipv6

## Notes

- ipinfo.io/ip (just curl the thing)
- may need to test with cell hotspot, because we may get some additional meta junk
- My friends on twitch have said they would, indeed, like to see the gatsby "for real" dev (but I can't do the actual client site on stream due to NDA)

## Goals

- Security group
- SG rules
- dynamically get my ip, pass in as a run-time var (to not leak to twitch)
- Do the ec2 bastion instance launch/kill based on a ternary

## Next steps
