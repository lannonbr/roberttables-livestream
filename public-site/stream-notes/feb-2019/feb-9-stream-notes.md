# Stream notes February 9, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Talk overview
- [x] Node now? Yup
- [ ] Raid over plans
- [x] Do the thing
- [ ] Retrospective

## Things we learned

- rwscheerer - Don't have spaces surrounding "=" in bash
- Terraform destroy _does_ have an `auto-approve` flag
- After destroy, there isn't any thing to log out (now show or outputs)
- Say command will not be reliable: It's not portable, and can't demo
- USB hub, webcams randomly quitting. I hear a "glitch" in the Arctis 7 chat sound
- VS Code, buggy integrated terminal (at my zoom level) that kills on resize

## Notes

- debug my video now (lul, audio is finally fine)
- We may very well require a full SD extension, in that case, its probably node all the way
- We can use this socket lib for streaming log tails to the browser, as a start [frotail](https://github.com/mthenw/frontail)

## Goals

- [x] Execute terraform correctly from script
- [x] Decide button layout - Folder for test, folder for live
- [x] Do we wanna go with bash or node? Decision (Depends on plugin need)
- [x] Create the Up/Down infra
- [x] I don't think we can catch execution status or errors? (we can't)
- [x] Can we drop in a component in the talk to watch the tailed logs?

## Next steps

- Talk outline
- Iconongraphy for talk
- Iconography for buttons
- Pass params/args to scripts with streamdeck
- JS SDK for AWS
- JS SDK for Streamdeck, make a plugin?
