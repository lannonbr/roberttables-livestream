# Stream notes February 21, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Switch soundtrack
- [x] Keyboard, is here!!
- [x] Project update
- [x] Do the thing
- [x] Retrospective

## Things we learned

- Can't really parameterize image file names in gql queries
- Potential issue with the twitch hightlighter, or my environment causes "tab key no worky"
- We're getting a lot of duplication in our "page" files (pull stuff into the layout.js component soon
- We are gonna need some flexbox or grid real soon
- Make a decision on how we show the browser preview as I'm developing on screen
- Also, try to pick a raid ahead of time
- And this keyboard is sexy

## Goals

- [x] Learn how to add images
- [ ] Get the rest of the pages using components
- [?] Extract the image to a data.json file (Cant really, but hacked)

## Next steps

- Clean up our mess
- Add a BUNCH more images/logos/icons
- Fill out the copy and the client copy,
- (and validate switching works) off stream or off screen during stream
- Buy a soldering iron for keyboard build
