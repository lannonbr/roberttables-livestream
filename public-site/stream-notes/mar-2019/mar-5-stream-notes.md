# Stream notes March 5, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Submote review (cpayette)
- [x] Discord update
- [x] Keyboard update, Hardware Saturday results
- [x] Developer onboarding (this project, not in general)
- [x] Problem statement and goal reviews for today
- [x] DO THE THING
- [x] Retrospective
- [x] Raid Somebody (Fritz!)

## Things we learned

- Return from all the things
- VS Code hang, still unsure what the issue is (talk to Clarkio)

## Goals

- [x] I need to loop over the files in the client dir, and create an object with the filename
- [x] And extension
- [x] And I need the image dimensions
- [ ] And then I need to check if that filename exists in the safe-for-stream images dir
- [ ] And then if not, make an api call to the placeholder service, and save that image
- [ ] And then commit only that utility, and the stream-safe images

## Next steps

- Do the thing with the file diffing
- Write the files out
- Print a short report of file changed
- Start the layout using images and flexbox? And/or CSS grid
- We also have the nav to abstract to our "language file"
