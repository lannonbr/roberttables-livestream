## What did we learn

- I need some kind of a jig to pre-tin wires for solder prep
- We should probably have a commands command that gets sent to chat regularly
- (PakmanJr): If you bend pins out a tiny bit you can get better socket adhesion

## Next steps

- AM Detector and test
- 2nd, then 1st amplifiers
- I wonder how that transistor board will hold up just attached on the socket?
