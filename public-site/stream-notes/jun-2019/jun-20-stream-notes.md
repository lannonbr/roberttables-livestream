# Stream notes June 20, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Intro and inside baseball build
- [x] What is this clock project
- [x] DO THE THING
- [x] Retrospective
- [ ] Potentially a raid

## Goals

- [x] Let's get most of the components on side 1 soldered
- [x] Do the other side too!
- [x] Let update our streamnotes and push them out

## What did we learn

- CR-is batteries... I need to get the right battery for the clock
- Also, it's a multifunction clock/timer/temperature display
- The acrylic case is the same assembly method as the animated led star case
-

## Next steps

- Apply the film
- Source the battery (lithinum CR-something) from amazong
- Peel the acrylic case and assemble
- Consider 5v battery supply instead of usb plug
