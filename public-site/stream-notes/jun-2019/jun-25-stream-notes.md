# Stream notes June 22, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Intro, review saturday hardware and future plans
- [x] Chat bot revisit
- [x] Set up a sane chat bot for dev (and don't get it banned)
- [x] DO THE THING
- [x] Retrospective
- [x] Raid and site deploy

## Goals

- [x] Comfy.js project
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose
- [ ] Muliple connections test
- [x] Careful with your secrets!

## What did we learn

- Visually designing systems facilitates group opinions
- People absorb info in many ways. Visual learners tend to also communicate visually.

## Next steps

- Add system diagram to repo
- Start building out the chat listener with ComfyJS

## Meta

- Need a !ted/!tedtalk command
- TheHugoDahl - "Computer" alexa commands from Star trek TNG do work
- THeHugoDahl - Github "keep my address private" results in a placeholder email address created for you, to use in package.json or similar things
