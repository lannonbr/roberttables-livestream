# Stream notes June 22, 2019

## Segments

- [x] Intro, Twitchcon tix, possible game stream
- [x] Project overview
- [x] DO THE THING
- [x] Retrospective
- [x] Raid and site deploy

## Goals

- [x] Board soldered
- [ ] Board assembed
- [x] Board working?

## What did we learn

- [Input resistor value, get colors](http://kiloohm.info/resistor-5/brown-black-black-brown-gold)
- Color balance effects my vision when reading resistor bands (especially blue metalic resistor)
- 4th and 5th (in 4-band resistors) usually have some space'
- I need to star paying better attention to the batteries required by some of these amazon electronics kits (I don't have the range I thought I did)

## Next steps

- Custom paint job for the calculator
- 

## Meta

- [Product Link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076SBY7DG/)
- [Project Instructions](http://www.diyleyuan.com/jc/L8Q.html)
- ElectricHavoc paint idea: Paint the inside of the acrylic, and leave the outside clear without paint
- ElectricHavoc paint idea 2: Plasti-dip on the inside with clear sections masked for some see-through effect (can use stripes or shapes for the mask area)
